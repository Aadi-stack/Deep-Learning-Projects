Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. We will use image classification using CNN and build a mobile app using which a farmer can take a picture and the app will tell you if the plant has a disease or not. The technology stack for this project will be,

Model Building: TensorFlow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
Backend Server and ML Ops: tf serving, FastAPI
Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow Lite
Frontend: React JS, React Native
Deployment: GCP (Google Cloud Platform, GCF (Google Cloud functions)
